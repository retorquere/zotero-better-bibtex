<!--
If your bug report/feature request/question concerns problems with exporting references, please specify whether you're exporting BibTeX or BibLaTeX.

If your issue is about exports of any kind, please right-click the references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

If your issue is a bug report, but not for exports, please enable extended debugging in the BBT preferences, reproduce your problem, and select "Report Better BibTeX error" from the Zotero gear menu, and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

If you wish to report a combination of feature requests, bug reports and general usage questions, please file a separate report for each of these. It is easier for me to manage them separately.
