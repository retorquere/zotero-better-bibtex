# Submitting an issue to the BBT bug tracker

If you wish to report a combination of feature requests, bug reports and general usage questions, please file a separate report for each of these. It is easier for me to manage them separately. Thank you.

DO NOT CLOSE ISSUES unless you've opened it by accident. After the problem is resolved I need to still make sure the fix gets into the release, and open issues remind me of that.

# Bug classification

## Exporting references

If your bug report/feature request/question concerns problems with exporting references, please specify whether you're exporting BibTeX or BibLaTeX. Please right-click the references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

## Non-export problems with BBT

If your issue is a bug report, but not for exports, restart Zotero with debugging enabled (Help -> Debug Output Logging -> Restart with logging enabled), reproduce your problem, and select "Report Better BibTeX error" from the help menu, and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.
