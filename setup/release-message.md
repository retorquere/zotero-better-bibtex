This release is compatible with Zotero 8 and Zotero 9 beta. The releases are currently also still compatible with Zotero 7.0.32, but that is now considered legacy, and will not get ongoing support.

If you use Firefox, make sure to right-click and save the XPI file, not just clicking it.

You can verify you are on the latest version by going into 'Tools' -> 'Addons' in Zotero/Juris-M, clicking the gear icon, and selecting 'Check for updates'
