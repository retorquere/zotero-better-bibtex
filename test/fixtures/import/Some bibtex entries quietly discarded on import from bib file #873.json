Such agents must monitor the world and respond appropriately to important events. The agents should be able to accept goals, synthesize complex plans for achieving those goals, and execute the plans while continuing to be responsive to changes in the world. As events render some current activities obsolete, the agents should be able to modify their plans while continuing activities unaffected by those events. The CYPRESS system is a domain-independent framework for defining persistent agents with this full range of behavior. CYPRESS has been used for several demanding applications, including military operations, real-time tracking, and fault diagnosis.",

      "abstractNote": "Applications that require alternative plans challenge the single solution, single quality metric assumptions upon which many classical planners are designed and evaluated. To evaluate the distinctness of alternative plans (i.e., plan sets), researchers have created diversity metrics that often measure the set difference between the actions of plans. Many approaches for generating plan sets embed the same diversity metric in a weighted evaluation function to guide the search mechanism, thus confounding the search process with its evaluation. We discover that two diversity metrics fail to distinguish similar plans from each other or to identify plans with extraneous actions, so we introduce two new diversity metrics, <i>uniqueness</i> and <i>overlap</i>, to capture these cases. We then examine the tradeoffs of producing diverse plans while we control for plan length and metric interaction and confirm that metric interaction can significantly impact search performance. We show that planners searching for plan sets must consider a third metric, <i>parsimony</i>, that prefers shorter plans while maximizing diversity.We evaluate three existing approaches for generating diverse plans and two new algorithms that are designed to explicitly manage diversity and interaction between the diversity and quality metrics. Our findings synthesize and extend recent results in plan diversity.",

They are embodied in several knowledge-based systems and are used to develop various real-life applications. The Description Logic Handbook provides a thorough account of the subject, covering all aspects of research in this field, namely: theory, implementation, and applications. Its appeal will be broad, ranging from more theoretically-oriented readers, to those with more practically-oriented interests who need a sound and modern understanding of knowledge representation systems based on Description Logics. The chapters are written by some of the most prominent researchers in the field, introducing the basic technical material before taking the reader to the current state of the subject, and including comprehensive guides to the literature. In sum, the book will serve as a unique reference for the subject, and can also be used for self-study or in conjunction with Knowledge Representation and Artificial Intelligence courses.",

      "abstractNote": "Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning (Sacerdoti 1974) is an approach to planning where problem-specific knowledge is used to remedy the computational intractability of classical planning. This knowledge is in the form of task decomposition directives, i.e. the planner is given a set of methods that tell it how a high-level task can be decomposed into lower-level tasks. The HTN planning problem consists in computing a sequence of primitive tasks that corresponds to performing the initial set of high-level tasks. Our purpose in this prthis paper is 1) to give an account of HTNplanning as high-level programming in the situation calculus (McCarthy 1963) based languages Golog/ConGolog (Levesque et al. 1997; De Giacomo, Lesperance, & Levesque 2000) and 2) to illustrate our approach with a ConGolog encoding of a logistics domain HTN-planning problem. The Golog/ConGolog languages have been extended to deal with explicit time, sensing actions, exogenous events, execution monitoring, incomplete knowledge of the initial state, stochastic actions and others. Thus the range of problems that can be tackled with this approach is potentially much larger. As an example, we modified the logistics domain encoding to execute on-line and deal with run-time exogenous delivery requests",

In many domains, human expertise in the form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but is incomplete. In such domains, hybrid approaches that use both HTN and action-based planning techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend our previous work on refinement planning to include hierarchical planning. Specifically, we provide a generalized plan-space refinement that is capable of handling non-primitive actions. The generalization provides a principled way of handling partially hierarchical domains, while preserving systematicity, and respecting the user-intent inherent in the reduction schemas. Our general account also puts into perspective the many surface differences between the HTN and action-based planners, and could support the transfer of progress between HTN and action-based planning approaches.",

Also shows how to do this in partially hierarchical domains, i.e., those where some goals do not have methods and use normal precondition-chaining. This doesn't really arise in our playbook applications, but it's very neat. Hard to tell how well this works out, since there are a whole bunch of fairly complex bits necessary to ensure completeness and systematicity. The latter could, of course, be sacrificed.

      "abstractNote": "Planning is a central activity in many areas including robotics, manufacturing, space mission sequencing, and logistics. As the size and complexity of planning problems grow, there is great economic pressure to automate this process in order to reduce the cost of planning effort, and to improve the quality of produced plans. AI planning research has focused on general-purpose planning systems which can process the specifications of an application domain and generate solutions to planning problems in that domain. Unfortunately, there is a big gap between theoretical and application oriented work in AI planning. The theoretical work has been mostly based on state-based planning, which has limited practical applications. The application-oriented work has been based on hierarchical task network (HTN) planning, which lacks a theoretical foundation. As a result, in spite of many years of research, building planning applications remains a formidable task. The goal of this dissertation is to facilitate building reliable and effective planning applications. The methodology includes design of a mathematical framework for HTN planning, analysis of this framework, development of provably correct algorithms based on this analysis, and the implementation of these algorithms for further evaluation and exploration. The representation, analyses, and algorithms described in this thesis will make it easier to apply HTN planning techniques effectively and correctly to planning applications. The precise and mathematical nature of the descriptions will also help teaching about HTN planning, will clarify misconceptions in the literature, and will stimulate further research.",

For example, it can do planning problems that require complex numeric computations. * In our tests, SHOP solved problems several orders of magnitude faster than Blackbox and TLplan.

A consequence of this view of the situation calculus is to establish direct connections with different variants of the mu-calculus, structural operational semantics of concurrent processes, and logic programming. First we show that the induction principle on situations is implied by an inductive definition of the set of situations. Then we consider the frame problem from the point of view of inductive definability and by defining fluents inductively we obtain essentially the same form of successor state axioms as Reiter's. Our approach allows extending this result to the case where ramification constraints are present.

        "Baker discusses ways in which dynamic backtracking can behave exponentially worse than simpler approaches, in particular depth-first search and backjumping. Briefly, the intuition is that in the attempt to preserve work done through backtracking, dynamic backtracking often preserves constraints propagated from value choices that have since been retracted, confining it in bad parts of the search space."

        "Describes a technique for adding automatic repair to model checking verification. They use abductive model revision to alter a concurrent program description in the face of a counterexample. Their concurrent programs are described in terms of jumps and (boolean) assignments. Repairs are in terms of changing assignment values and changing assignment orderings. The class of repairs considered here seem most appropriate for handling concurrency protocol errors, especially involving mutual exclusion and deadlocks. They seem less appropriate for control applications. Counterexamples are used to reduce the set of repair candidates that must be considered. (In order to handle ACTL formulas, the authors consider tree-shaped counterexamples, not just simple linear counterexamples.) In particular, their technique \u201cidentifies corrections \u03b1 under which the counterexample is invariant, i.e., still apply if \u03b1 is implemented.\u201d They introduce efficiently computable conditions on counterexamples and corrections that provide this filtering."

        "Cohen and Levesque critique KQML on three semantic grounds: ambiguity of specifications; misidentified performatives and performatives missing. The misidentified performatives are those that operate on other performatives where Cohen and Levesque argue that they should be operating directly on content. The major missing performative they identify is a commissive \u2014 the agreement to perform an action. They then propose that their logic of intention could be used to give a superior semantics. They conclude with some weak suggestions about the implications of this. Unfortunately, their semantics seem to be too \u201cfirst principles-y\u201d to be of much use to implementors. Finally, they say that extensibility and content independence are problems. It is hard to see how this is to be remedied."

The accomplishment is less overwhelming than it might at first seem, because the HTN plan's semantics rests on STRIPS-style world updates. So an HTN planner constructed according to this method will have the same knowledge-engineering demands as a first-principles STRIPS planner."

        "Erol, et. al. discuss the complexity and expressivity of HTN planning based on their UMCP planning. They show that HTN planning is strictly more expressive than simple STRIPS planning. The reason HTN planning is more expressive is that having a goal task network instead of a propositional goal allows the user of the system to specify not just what is to be achieved, but some aspects of how it is to be achieved. They use the example that in an HTN planner one can specify the goal of \u201cbuild a house,\u201d as distinct from simply \u201cown a house,\u201d which could also be satisfied by \u201cbuy a house.\u201d As far as expressivity is concerned, HTN planning in the general case is undecidable. Forcing HTNs to be totally-ordered sets of tasks or removing variables from the tasks can reduce the complexity."

        "tex.acontentnote: Abstract: Closed-world inference-an essential component of many planning algorithms-is the process of determining that a logical sentence is false based on its absence from a knowledge base, or the inability to derive it. We describe a novel method for closed-world inference and update over the first-order theories of action used by planning algorithms such as NONLIN, TWEAK, and UCPOP. We show the method to be sound and efficient, but incomplete. In our experiments, closed-world inference consistently averaged about 2 milliseconds while updates averaged approximately 1.2 milliseconds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incompleteness is nonproblematic in practice, since our mechanism makes over 99% of the desired inferences. We incorporated our method into the XII planner, which supports our Internet Softbot (software robot). The technique cut the number of actions executed by the Softbot by a factor of one hundred, and resulted in a corresponding speedup to XII.",

        "Wow! A paper containing the germs of a vast amount of other work. Explains how <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Strips</span> plans are to be executed, stored, and reused. The key to all of these techniques are the <i>triangle tables</i>, which are a limited form of explanation-based learning. They also underly the approach to execution monitoring. For the plan monitoring, the triangle table contains a cached out representation of the preconditions necessary for execution of each plan suffix. So the executor monitors the truth of each of these preconditions, allowing it both to re-execute failed prefixes and exploit opportunities to skip steps."

Essentially the approach is to perform a Moore-like translation of the modal logic statements into a first order representation with explicit representation of the accessibility relations and existence of entities (for modal logics with different domains in different possible worlds). This representation is then partititioned into a set of statements and an associated set of constraints on relationships between possible worlds. When variables are unified, the associated world constraints must be verified."

        "Gives a summary of three-layer architectures for mobile robots. Gat's division into three layers is based on memory and algorithm run-time in the three layers: deliberation layer (top) allows algorithms with long latencies: several Behavior transitions can occur before one of these terminates. The middle layer is the sequencer, whose job it is to select primitive Behaviors, and supply parameters. The Sequencer is allowed to use algorithms with memory. At the bottom level is the Controller, which contains Behaviors, which should run one iteration in constant-bounded time and space, ideally being continuous in the input, and not using memory (although Gat makes exception for filters). Gat also argues that behaviors should fail cognizantly. This is interesting, because not what I would have expected because I'm either (a) a planning bigot or (b) realistic about the fact that one typically doesn't own an entire execution platform, depending on whether you're being (a) harsh or (b) kind. I tend to think that you are given the Controller (or at least a subset thereof), and that cognizant failure may be more than you can ask. Also the Sequencer is needed to provide a plan-cognizant layer above the Controller, which typically doesn't know anything about the context of its behaviors."

        "LDS is a search technique that iteratively makes n decisions differently from the dictates of its heuristic, for increasing n. The intuition behind LDS is that heuristics often give recommendations that are worse at the start of the search than at the end. Accordingly, LDS makes divergent decisions initially at the beginning of the search path, working towards the end. Note that were this assumption wrong, depth-first search would work well, because it undoes decisions first at the end of the search. Harvey and Ginsberg also discuss combining LDS with bounded-backtrack search, which they show gives better behavior in large search spaces."

The reason for this is that the excluded middle does not hold in the logic of partial plans \u2014 the truth value of some p in some completion of a partial plan may not be defined, because the completion may be ill-formed."

The work is interesting and offers checking to make sure that transitions are well-founded, in terms of the objects that make up the domain. Somewhat limited, however, in terms of the richness of the object hierarchy, and the sorts of things that an HTN method is allowed to do. There's a discussion of how OCL\u2095 could be used to formalize O-Plan operators."

        "Provides a representation of knowledge-producing actions in the situation calculus. Extends Reiter's explanation-closure solution to the frame problem to this extended situation calculus (in which successor state axioms are automatically generated from General Positive Effect and General Negative Effect axioms). The authors show that knowledge-producing actions can be handled using Reiter's explanation-closure approach. Further, they extend Reiter's regression operators to knowledge-producing actions. This permits one to check properties of a plan (e.g., does it achieve a particular goal proposition) by regressing those properties to the initial situation and then doing theorem-proving exclusively in that initial situation."

      "abstractNote": "Abstract Planning is motivated by acting. Most of the existing work on automated planning underestimates the reasoning and deliberation needed for acting; it is instead biased towards path-finding methods in a compactly specified state-transition system. Researchers in this {AI} field have developed many planners, but very few actors. We believe this is one of the main causes of the relatively low deployment of automated planning applications. In this paper, we advocate a change in focus to actors as the primary topic of investigation. Actors are not mere plan executors: they may use planning and other deliberation tools, before and during acting. This change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actor\u02bcs deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process. In the paper, we discuss open problems and research directions toward that objective in knowledge representations, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration.",

      "abstractNote": "Shortcomings of qualitative simulation and of quantitative simulation motivate combining them to do simulations exhibiting strengths of both. The resulting class of techniques is called semiquantitative simulation. One approach to semi-quantitative simulation is to use numeric intervals to represent incomplete quantitative information. In this research we demonstrate semi-quantitative simulation using intervals in an implemented semi-quantitative simulator called Q3. Q3 progressively refines a qualitative simulation, providing increasingly specific quantitative predictions which can converge to a numerical simulation in the limit while retaining important correctness guarantees from qualitative and interval simulation techniques. Q3's simulations are based on a technique we call step size refinement. While a pure qualitative simulation has a very coarse step size, representing the state of a system trajectory at relatively few qualitatively distinct states, Q3 interpolates newly explicit states between distinct qualitative states, thereby representing more states which instantiate new constraints, leading to improved quantitative inferences. Q3's techniques have been used for prediction, measurement interpretation, diagnosis, and even analysis of the probabilities of qualitative behaviors. Because Q3 shares important expressive and inferential properties of both qualitative and quantitative simulation, Q3 helps to bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative simulation.",
