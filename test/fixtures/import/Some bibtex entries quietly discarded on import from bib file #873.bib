                  all of these techniques are the \emph{triangle
                  tables}, which are a limited form of
                  explanation-based learning. They also underly the
                  approach to execution monitoring. For the plan
                  monitoring, the triangle table contains a cached out
                  representation of the preconditions necessary for
                  execution of each plan suffix. So the executor
                  monitors the truth of each of these preconditions,
                  allowing it both to re-execute failed prefixes and
                  exploit opportunities to skip steps.}

                 the same order that they will later be executed. This
                 avoids some of the goal-interaction issues that arise
                 in other HTN planners, thus making the planning
                 algorithm relatively simple. * The planning algorithm
                 is sound and complete over a large class of problems. *
                 Since SHOP knows the complete world-state at each step
                 of the planning process, it can use highly expressive
                 domain representations. For example, it can do planning
                 problems that require complex numeric computations. *
                 In our tests, SHOP solved problems several orders of
                 magnitude faster than Blackbox and TLplan. This occured
                 even though SHOP is written in Lisp and the other

		  The misidentified performatives are those that operate
		  on other performatives where Cohen and Levesque argue
		  that they should be operating directly on content.
		  The major missing performative they identify is 
		  a commissive --- the agreement to perform an
		  action.  They then propose that their logic of intention
		  could be used to give a superior semantics.  They conclude
		  with some weak suggestions about the implications of this.
		  Unfortunately, their semantics seem to be too ``first
		  principles-y'' to be of much use to implementors.  
		  Finally, they say that extensibility and content
		  independence are problems.  It is hard to see how this
		  is to be remedied.}

  abstract =	 "Hierarchical task network and action-based planning
                  approaches have traditionally been studied
                  separately. In many domains, human expertise in the
                  form of hierarchical reduction schemas exists, but
                  is incomplete. In such domains, hybrid approaches
                  that use both HTN and action-based planning
                  techniques are needed. In this paper, we extend our
                  previous work on refinement planning to include
                  hierarchical planning. Specifically, we provide a
                  generalized plan-space refinement that is capable of
                  handling non-primitive actions. The generalization
                  provides a principled way of handling partially
                  hierarchical domains, while preserving
                  systematicity, and respecting the user-intent
                  inherent in the reduction schemas. Our general
                  account also puts into perspective the many surface
                  differences between the HTN and action-based
                  planners, and could support the transfer of progress
                  between HTN and action-based planning approaches.",

		  expressive is that having a goal task network instead of 
		  a propositional goal allows the user of the system to 
		  specify not just what is to be achieved, but some aspects of 
		  how it is to be achieved.  They use the example that in an
		  HTN planner one can specify the goal of ``build a house,''
		  as distinct from simply ``own a house,'' which could also
		  be satisfied by ``buy a house.''  As far as expressivity 
		  is concerned, HTN planning in the general case is

                  including robotics, manufacturing, space mission
                  sequencing, and logistics. As the size and
                  complexity of planning problems grow, there is great
                  economic pressure to automate this process in order
                  to reduce the cost of planning effort, and to
                  improve the quality of produced plans. AI planning
                  research has focused on general-purpose planning
                  systems which can process the specifications of an
                  application domain and generate solutions to
                  planning problems in that domain. Unfortunately,
                  there is a big gap between theoretical and
                  application oriented work in AI planning. The
                  theoretical work has been mostly based on
                  state-based planning, which has limited practical
                  applications. The application-oriented work has been
                  based on hierarchical task network (HTN) planning,
                  which lacks a theoretical foundation. As a result,
                  in spite of many years of research, building
                  planning applications remains a formidable task. The
                  goal of this dissertation is to facilitate building
                  reliable and effective planning applications. The
                  methodology includes design of a mathematical
                  framework for HTN planning, analysis of this
                  framework, development of provably correct
                  algorithms based on this analysis, and the
                  implementation of these algorithms for further
                  evaluation and exploration. The representation,
                  analyses, and algorithms described in this thesis
                  will make it easier to apply HTN planning techniques
                  effectively and correctly to planning
                  applications. The precise and mathematical nature of
                  the descriptions will also help teaching about HTN
                  planning, will clarify misconceptions in the
                  literature, and will stimulate further research."

                  based on memory and algorithm run-time in the three
                  layers: deliberation layer (top) allows algorithms
                  with long latencies: several Behavior transitions
                  can occur before one of these terminates. The middle
                  layer is the sequencer, whose job it is to select
                  primitive Behaviors, and supply parameters. The
                  Sequencer is allowed to use algorithms with
                  memory. At the bottom level is the Controller, which
                  contains Behaviors, which should run one iteration
                  in constant-bounded time and space, ideally being
                  continuous in the input, and not using memory
                  (although Gat makes exception for filters). Gat also
                  argues that behaviors should fail cognizantly. This
                  is interesting, because not what I would have
                  expected because I'm either (a) a planning bigot or
                  (b) realistic about the fact that one typically
                  doesn't own an entire execution platform, depending
                  on whether you're being (a) harsh or (b) kind. I
                  tend to think that you are given the Controller (or
                  at least a subset thereof), and that cognizant
                  failure may be more than you can ask. Also the
                  Sequencer is needed to provide a plan-cognizant
                  layer above the Controller, which typically doesn't
                  know anything about the context of its behaviors.}

                 require several capabilities for successful operation.
                 Such agents must monitor the world and respond
                 appropriately to important events. The agents should be
                 able to accept goals, synthesize complex plans for
                 achieving those goals, and execute the plans while
                 continuing to be responsive to changes in the world. As
                 events render some current activities obsolete, the
                 agents should be able to modify their plans while
                 continuing activities unaffected by those events. The
                 CYPRESS system is a domain-independent framework for
                 defining persistent agents with this full range of
                 behavior. CYPRESS has been used for several demanding
                 applications, including military operations, real-time
                 tracking, and fault diagnosis.",

                  description in the face of a counterexample. Their
                  concurrent programs are described in terms of jumps
                  and (boolean) assignments. Repairs are in terms of
                  changing assignment values and changing assignment
                  orderings. The class of repairs considered here seem
                  most appropriate for handling concurrency protocol
                  errors, especially involving mutual exclusion and
                  deadlocks. They seem less appropriate for control
                  applications. Counterexamples are used to reduce the
                  set of repair candidates that must be
                  considered. (In order to handle ACTL formulas, the
                  authors consider tree-shaped counterexamples, not
                  just simple linear counterexamples.) In particular,
                  their technique ``identifies corrections $\alpha$
                  under which the counterexample is invariant, i.e.,
                  still apply if $\alpha$ is implemented.'' They
                  introduce efficiently computable conditions on
                  counterexamples and corrections that provide this
                  filtering.}

                 direct connections with different variants of the mu-calculus,
                 structural operational semantics of concurrent
                 processes, and logic programming.
                 First we show that the induction principle on
                 situations is implied by an inductive
                 definition of the set of situations. Then we consider
                 the frame problem from the point of view of inductive
                 definability and by defining fluents inductively we
                 obtain essentially the same form of successor state
                 axioms as Reiter's. Our approach allows extending
                 this result to the case where ramification constraints
                 are present. Finally we demonstrate a method of
                 applying inductive definitions for computing fixed

                  1974) is an approach to planning where
                  problem-specific knowledge is used to remedy the
                  computational intractability of classical
                  planning. This knowledge is in the form of task
                  decomposition directives, i.e. the planner is given
                  a set of methods that tell it how a high-level task
                  can be decomposed into lower-level tasks. The HTN
                  planning problem consists in computing a sequence of
                  primitive tasks that corresponds to performing the
                  initial set of high-level tasks. Our purpose in this
                  prthis paper is 1) to give an account of HTNplanning
                  as high-level programming in the situation calculus
                  (McCarthy 1963) based languages Golog/ConGolog
                  (Levesque et al. 1997; De Giacomo, Lesperance, \&
                  Levesque 2000) and 2) to illustrate our approach
                  with a ConGolog encoding of a logistics domain
                  HTN-planning problem. The Golog/ConGolog languages
                  have been extended to deal with explicit time,
                  sensing actions, exogenous events, execution
                  monitoring, incomplete knowledge of the initial
                  state, stochastic actions and others. Thus the range
                  of problems that can be tackled with this approach
                  is potentially much larger. As an example, we
                  modified the logistics domain encoding to execute
                  on-line and deal with run-time exogenous delivery
                  requests",

		 inference and update over the first-order theories of
		 action used by planning algorithms such as NONLIN,
		 TWEAK, and UCPOP. We show the method to be sound and
		 efficient, but incomplete. In our experiments,
		 closed-world inference consistently averaged about 2
		 milliseconds while updates averaged approximately 1.2
		 milliseconds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
		 incompleteness is nonproblematic in practice, since our
		 mechanism makes over 99% of the desired inferences. We
		 incorporated our method into the XII planner, which
		 supports our Internet Softbot (software robot). The
		 technique cut the number of actions executed by the
		 Softbot by a factor of one hundred, and resulted in a
		 corresponding speedup to XII.",

		 representation languages that have been studied
		 extensively in Artificial Intelligence over the last
		 two decades. They are embodied in several
		 knowledge-based systems and are used to develop various
		 real-life applications. The Description Logic Handbook
		 provides a thorough account of the subject, covering
		 all aspects of research in this field, namely: theory,
		 implementation, and applications. Its appeal will be
		 broad, ranging from more theoretically-oriented
		 readers, to those with more practically-oriented
		 interests who need a sound and modern understanding of
		 knowledge representation systems based on Description
		 Logics. The chapters are written by some of the most
		 prominent researchers in the field, introducing the
		 basic technical material before taking the reader to
		 the current state of the subject, and including
		 comprehensive guides to the literature. In sum, the
		 book will serve as a unique reference for the subject,
		 and can also be used for self-study or in conjunction
		 with Knowledge Representation and Artificial
		 Intelligence courses.",

                  single solution, single quality metric assumptions upon which
                  many classical planners are designed and evaluated. To
                  evaluate the distinctness of alternative plans (i.e., plan
                  sets), researchers have created diversity metrics that often
                  measure the set difference between the actions of plans. Many
                  approaches for generating plan sets embed the same diversity
                  metric in a weighted evaluation function to guide the search
                  mechanism, thus confounding the search process with its
                  evaluation. We discover that two diversity metrics fail to
                  distinguish similar plans from each other or to identify plans
                  with extraneous actions, so we introduce two new diversity
                  metrics, \emph{uniqueness} and \emph{overlap}, to capture
                  these cases. We then examine the tradeoffs of producing
                  diverse plans while we control for plan length and metric
                  interaction and confirm that metric interaction can
                  significantly impact search performance.  We show that
                  planners searching for plan sets must consider a third metric,
                  \emph{parsimony}, that prefers shorter plans while maximizing
                  diversity.We evaluate three existing approaches for generating
                  diverse plans and two new algorithms that are designed to
                  explicitly manage diversity and interaction between the
                  diversity and quality metrics. Our findings synthesize and
                  extend recent results in plan diversity.},

  abstract =     "Abstract Planning is motivated by acting. Most of the existing
                  work on automated planning underestimates the reasoning and
                  deliberation needed for acting; it is instead biased towards
                  path-finding methods in a compactly specified state-transition
                  system. Researchers in this \{AI\} field have developed many
                  planners, but very few actors. We believe this is one of the
                  main causes of the relatively low deployment of automated
                  planning applications. In this paper, we advocate a change in
                  focus to actors as the primary topic of investigation. Actors
                  are not mere plan executors: they may use planning and other
                  deliberation tools, before and during acting. This change in
                  focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical
                  structure to integrate the actorʼs deliberation functions, and
                  continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting
                  process. In the paper, we discuss open problems and research
                  directions toward that objective in knowledge representations,
                  model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement,
                  monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration. "

                  quantitative simulation motivate combining them to
                  do simulations exhibiting strengths of both. The
                  resulting class of techniques is called
                  semiquantitative simulation. One approach to
                  semi-quantitative simulation is to use numeric
                  intervals to represent incomplete quantitative
                  information. In this research we demonstrate
                  semi-quantitative simulation using intervals in an
                  implemented semi-quantitative simulator called
                  Q3. Q3 progressively refines a qualitative
                  simulation, providing increasingly specific
                  quantitative predictions which can converge to a
                  numerical simulation in the limit while retaining
                  important correctness guarantees from qualitative
                  and interval simulation techniques. Q3's simulations
                  are based on a technique we call step size
                  refinement. While a pure qualitative simulation has
                  a very coarse step size, representing the state of a
                  system trajectory at relatively few qualitatively
                  distinct states, Q3 interpolates newly explicit
                  states between distinct qualitative states, thereby
                  representing more states which instantiate new
                  constraints, leading to improved quantitative
                  inferences. Q3's techniques have been used for
                  prediction, measurement interpretation, diagnosis,
                  and even analysis of the probabilities of
                  qualitative behaviors. Because Q3 shares important
                  expressive and inferential properties of both
                  qualitative and quantitative simulation, Q3 helps to
                  bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative
                  simulation."
