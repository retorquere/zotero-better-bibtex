Doesn't import as a thesis reference

@Thesis{Bennett2003,
  Title = {Xenonika: medical texts associated with xenones in the late Byzantine period},
  Author = {Bennett, David Christopher},
  Date = {2003},
  Institution = {University of London},
  Type = {Ph.D.},
}

An example of the \mkbibemph command:

@Incollection{Cooper2013,
Title = {Byzantium between East and West: Competing Hellenisms in the \mkbibemph{Alexiad} of Anna Komnene and her Contemporaries},
Author = {Glen Cooper},
Crossref = {Classen2013},
Date = {2013},
Pages = {263-87}
}

A journal article with the journaltitle field:

@Article{Correns1891,
Title = {Die dem Boethius fälschlich zugeschriebene Abhandlung des Dominicus Gundisalvi {'De} unitate'},
Date = {1891},
Journaltitle = {Beiträge zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters},
Pages = {1-11},
Volume = {1},
Editor = {Correns, Paul},
}

An example of the (somewhat weird) biblatex-chicago Inreference entry type:

@Inreference{Algar1985,
Title = {Encyclopedia Iranica},
Lista = {Besmallah: in exegesis, jurisprudence, and cultural life},
Author = {Algar, Hamid},
Date = {1985},
Pages = {172-4},
Volume = {4}
}

And finally, an example of the Collection entry type:

@Collection{Arsdall2012,
Title = {Herbs and Healers from the Ancient Mediterranean through the Medieval West: Essays in Honor of John M. Riddle},
Date = {2012},
Editor = {Anne van Arsdall and Timothy Graham},
Location = {Burlington, VT},
Publisher = {Ashgate},
}
