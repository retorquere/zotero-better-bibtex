      "abstractNote": "<p class=\"first\" id=\"d388814e66\">To defend the thesis of \u201cpermanent violence\u201d in Yemen that leads to state failure and in the context of the structural crisis of capital (where Keynesianism has reached its structural limits), this article will look at the Yemeni war through a Marxist lens. It aims to analyze the deep sociological roots of the Yemeni war through the laws of capital as presented by Marx and to show why the Yemeni war is a goal in itself for Imperialism. Three main laws of capital are considered: (1) the general law of capital accumulation developed in Volume I of <i>Das Kapital</i>, (2) the law of the \u201ctransformation\u201d of value into price as presented in Volume III of <i>Das Kapital</i>, and (3) the law relating to the contradiction between production and consumption (leading to a crisis of overproduction and a crisis of underconsumption) that was developed by Marx in the <i>Grundrisse</i>, in <i>Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</i>, and by contemporary Marxist author, Istvan M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros <i>.</i> All of these laws are all tied to the Marxist \u201claw of value\u201d which refers to the idea that socially necessary labor time acts as the ultimate regulating force in exchange and production under Imperialism. </p>",

The price of production is equal to the cost-price (capital spent on constant capital and variable capital, i.e., living labor16) + the average rate of profit of capital (that equalizes across different sectors and industries). This average rate of profit is a part of the total surplus value which reflects the rate of profit of firms with an average organic composition of capital.17 The capitals that manage to lower their price of production by increasing the organic composition of their capital vis-\u00e0-vis the average one will be able to incorporate \"absolute\" or \"relative\" surplus value (beyond the average one) in their goods to appropriate a higher share of profit in the free market at the expense of the rest of the capitals (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43P472HQ?page=5\">Kadri 2021:5</a>)</blockquote>",
