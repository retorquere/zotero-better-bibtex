This problem is severely ill-posed and has important practical applications. The theoretical optimal error bound for the problem is proved which is independent of the selected regularization methods. A modified Tikhonov regularization method with asymptotic order optimal error estimates is proposed. This method can be numerically implemented easily by the fast Fourier transform. Some numerical examples are provided and a comparison with a Fourier regularization method is given, which show the modified Tikhonov method works very well.},
