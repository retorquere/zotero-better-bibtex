  abstract = {Probability has become one of the most characteristic con cepts of modern culture, and a 'probabilistic way of thinking' may be said to have penetrated almost every sector of our in tellectual life. However it would be difficult to determine an explicit list of 'positive' features, to be proposed as identifica tion marks of this way of thinking. One would rather say that it is characterized by certain 'negative' features, i. e. by certain at titudes which appear to be the negation of well established tra ditional assumptions, conceptual frameworks, world outlooks and the like. It is because of this opposition to tradition that the probabilistic approach is perceived as expressing a 'modern' in tellectual style. As an example one could mention the widespread diffidence in philosophy with respect to self -contained systems claiming to express apodictic truths, instead of which much weaker pretensions are preferred, that express 'probable' interpretations of reality, of history, of man (the hermeneutic trend). An ana logous example is represented by the interest devoted to the study of different patterns of 'argumentation', dealing wiht reasonings which rely not so much on the truth of the premisses and stringent formal logic links, but on a display of contextual conditions (depending on the audience, and on accepted stan dards, judgements, and values), which render the premisses and the conclusions more 'probable' (the new rhetoric).},

However, like every other hypergeneral scientific theory, it can be enriched with specific assumptions and data, and thus become a specific model for a particular evolutionary line. This paper exhibits such a model. It accounts for the evolution of a biopopulation in terms of genetic and environmental variables. The results is a system of linear finite difference equations that enable one to pin down the necessary and sufficient conditions for evolution proper to occur, as well as to predict the average numbers of the final varieties originating from the parent population. It is estimated that the main value of the paper is methodological rather than substantive, in that it suggests a way of building models of biological lineages.},

Mathematicians and scientists too, whether basic or applied, have often taken part in philosophical discussions on probability. Notwithstanding such discussions, which have been numerous and often spirited, there is still considerable divergence of opinion concerning the interpretation of probability. (See e.g. du Pasquier 1926, Fine 1973.) This is probably due to the fact that the choice of interpretation is largely a matter of philosophy. Not that philosophy is necessarily inconclusive, but it does colour all thinking on fundamental questions.},

It traces the revival of naturalism to Quine's critique of the "a priori", and Kuhn's defense of historicism, and use the arguments of Quine and Kuhn to identify a position, "traditional naturalism", that combines naturalistic themes with the claim that epistemology is a normative enterprise. Pleas for more radical versions of naturalism are articulated, and briefly confronted (phil. index).},
