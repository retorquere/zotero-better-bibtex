Scientific realism is a positiveepistemic attitude towards the content of our best theories and models,recommending belief in both observable and unobservable aspects of theworld described by the sciences. This epistemic attitude has importantmetaphysical and semantic dimensions, and these various commitments arecontested by a number of rival epistemologies of science, knowncollectively as forms of scientific antirealism. This article explainswhat scientific realism is, outlines its main variants, considers themost common arguments for and against the position, and contrasts itwith its most important antirealist counterparts.},

Most philosophers agree that this type ofinference is frequently employed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientific reasoning. However, the exact form as wellas the normative status of abduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrasts abduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses of it, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or less precise statements of it; discusses its normative status; and highlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesian confirmation theory.},

  abstract = {The theory of evolution is too general to be able to make predictions. However, like every other hypergeneral scientific theory, it can be enriched with specific assumptions and data, and thus become a specific model for a particular evolutionary line. This paper exhibits such a model. It accounts for the evolution of a biopopulation in terms of genetic and environmental variables. The results is a system of linear finite difference equations that enable one to pin down the necessary and sufficient conditions for evolution proper to occur, as well as to predict the average numbers of the final varieties originating from the parent population. It is estimated that the main value of the paper is methodological rather than substantive, in that it suggests a way of building models of biological lineages.},

@book{Agazzi-1988-ProbabilitySciences,
  abstract = {Probability has become one of the most characteristic con cepts of modern culture, and a 'probabilistic way of thinking' may be said to have penetrated almost every sector of our in tellectual life. However it would be difficult to determine an explicit list of 'positive' features, to be proposed as identifica tion marks of this way of thinking. One would rather say that it is characterized by certain 'negative' features, i. e. by certain at titudes which appear to be the negation of well established tra ditional assumptions, conceptual frameworks, world outlooks and the like. It is because of this opposition to tradition that the probabilistic approach is perceived as expressing a 'modern' in tellectual style. As an example one could mention the widespread diffidence in philosophy with respect to self -contained systems claiming to express apodictic truths, instead of which much weaker pretensions are preferred, that express 'probable' interpretations of reality, of history, of man (the hermeneutic trend). An ana logous example is represented by the interest devoted to the study of different patterns of 'argumentation', dealing wiht reasonings which rely not so much on the truth of the premisses and stringent formal logic links, but on a display of contextual conditions (depending on the audience, and on accepted stan dards, judgements, and values), which render the premisses and the conclusions more 'probable' (the new rhetoric).},

Mathematicians and scientists too, whether basic or applied, have often taken part in philosophical discussions on probability. Notwithstanding such discussions, which have been numerous and often spirited, there is still considerable divergence of opinion concerning the interpretation of probability. (See e.g. du Pasquier 1926, Fine 1973.) This is probably due to the fact that the choice of interpretation is largely a matter of philosophy. Not that philosophy is necessarily inconclusive, but it does colour all thinking on fundamental questions.},

  abstract = {Unless propositional content can be shown to supervene on internal physical states of agents, the semantics (e.g., I want sorbet and I believe there is some in the freezer) that sometimes accompany our brain states must be causally irrelevant to agent behavior (e.g., my entering the kitchen and opening the freezer door). In a valiant effort to salvage an explanatory role for content without giving up the nonsupervenience thesis, Fred Dretske (Explaining Behavior, 1988) invents a special kind of content-involving causal model. I critically examine this model and show that, despite its ingenuity, it is wildly implausible.},

Both are grounded in a neo-Darwinian account of evolutionary adaptation.

Pleas for more radical versions of naturalism are articulated, and briefly confronted (phil. index).},
