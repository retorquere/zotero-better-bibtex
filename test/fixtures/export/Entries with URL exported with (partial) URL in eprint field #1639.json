      "abstractNote": "New information from Lesotho suggests a need to rethink common utilitarian and dualist approaches to livestock keeping in southern Africa. Non-commercial livestock practices in Lesotho can only be understood as the product of a particular cultural ordering of property which constitutes livestock and cash as distinct domains which are not freely inter-convertible. The cultural rules which define and valorise livestock as a special category of property are not residues from a traditional past but products of a contemporary social process which involves both local power relations and the larger structures of the regional migrant-labour economy which condition them. These power relations centre on the relationships: men/women (based on the division wage-earning husband/dependent wife), senior/junior (based on the division bridewealth receiver/ bridewealth giver), and patron/client (based on the division livestock lender/livestock borrower). So-called 'traditional' modes of stock-keeping thus rest on a structure of property which finds very modern attachments and points of support in a range of contemporary institutions of the household, community, and regional economy. This suggests a theoretical need to focus less on dualist spheres or utilitarian 'rational choices' and more on clusters of interconnexion that may cut across received analytical categories.",
