The theory is formulated in the perturbed-stationary-state approximation using accurate molecular wave functions for the ground II2 and \u03a32 states of HF+. Comparison is made to the predictions of the Born approximation. The magnetic selection rule (j,mj\u2192j,\u2212mj) is strongly violated in the j=32 state and less strongly violated in the j=12 state. It is concluded that the important region of interaction for the j=12\u2192j=32 transition is at short-to-intermediate distances where accurate molecular potentials are required and close-coupling effects are dominant.",
