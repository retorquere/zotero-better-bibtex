      "abstractNote": "The formation of bubbles in liquid-liquid impacts was studied with the aid of a high speed video. The resulting mechanisms for the formation of bubbles can be broken into three main groups: bubbles formed on initial drop impact, bubbles formed due to cavity collapse, and bubbles formed from thin film rupture by a floating drop. The largest bubble was formed by cavity collapse while fine clouds of bubbles were formed by a number of different mechanisms. The bubble sizes range from below 12 Î¼m to almost 1 mm in diameter, a range of almost three magnitudes. The regions for the different bubble mechanisms are a function of the Froude and Weber number of the impacting drop. In the region where floating drops exist, bubbles were generally formed from film drainage when We<6, while bubbles formed during rupture of a rapidly expanding trapped air film occurred between 6<We<20.",
