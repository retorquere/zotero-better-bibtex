  abstract = {In philosophy, episteme (Ancient Greek: {$\acute{\epsilon}\pi\iota\sigma\tau\acute{\eta}\mu\eta$}, romanized: epist\=em\=e, lit.\,'science, knowledge'; French: \'epist\'em\`e) is a term that refers to a principle system of understanding (i.e., knowledge), such as scientific knowledge or practical knowledge. The term comes from the Ancient Greek verb {$\acute{\epsilon}\pi\hat{\iota}\sigma\tau\breve{\alpha}\mu\alpha\iota$}, ep\'istamai, meaning 'to know, to understand, to be acquainted with'. The term epistemology (the branch of philosophy concerning knowledge) is derived from episteme. Plato contrasts episteme with doxa: common belief or opinion. The term episteme is also distinguished from techne: a craft or applied practice.  Socrates noted that nous and episteme is requisite for prudence (phronesis).},
