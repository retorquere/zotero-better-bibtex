\begin{itemize}

\item Clean experiment, shows different optimal constellation for OPC than for regular transmission. Good work

\item The amount of work is impressive, and the problem is addressed for the first time in case of OPC, however, it is not an important problem, since OPC is not industrially feasible. Borderline.

\end{itemize}}
