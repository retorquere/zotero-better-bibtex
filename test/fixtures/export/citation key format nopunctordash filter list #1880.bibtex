  abstract = {先秦時論述「禮」往往透過《詩》以進行詮釋，儀式中亦大量引用《詩》。以《詩》詮禮並不只是便於解釋某些情境；《詩》之「引譬連類」亦不只是修辭的方式，其中還牽涉與自然萬物的關係，以及因氣化共感而興發的原初情感與倫理課題。本文透過先秦禮儀論述中以《詩》詮禮，以及儀式中之引《詩》現象，說明禮儀的精神，並重新思考禮儀與「民性」的關係。同時透過論述禮儀、道德、為學工夫時，往往以《詩》進行詮解的現象，探討以《詩》詮禮與修身的關係。最後透過詩、樂、舞之整體情境探討其於血氣心知轉化的意義。本文希望透過《詩》之詮釋與實踐等角度，重新思考禮儀如何回應自然、身體、倫理等課題，以展開充滿生生不息動力與情感的禮儀風景。Pre-Qin interpretations of ＂rites＂ cited extensively from the Book of Odes in order to facilitate the interpretation of certain contexts. The practice of ＂analogizing categories＂, for example, was a rhetorical method that implicated relationships with all things in nature and, through the mutual stimulation of ＂qi＂氣, gave rise to issues related to both the original emotions and ethics. This article explains the spirit of Pre-Qin rituals and reconsiders the relationship between rites and ＂the people's character＂ through reference to the poetic interpretation of rites as well as citations from the ＂Book of Odes＂. At the same time, it argues that imagery from the ＂Book of Odes＂ produces possibilities for new connections and new meanings. The article moreover explores the significance of poetry, music, and dance in rituals as they are converted to blood, ＂qi＂, body, and heart. Finally, in an effort to show how rites can be lively and emotional, it considers how rituals can be read as responses to the nature, the body, and ethics.},
