Overall, the analysis illustrates how one particular sporting event offers insights into the role of sport as part of a wider set of relations of globalization, politics, economics and cultural identity. This paper is divided into three main parts: (1) the social and cultural significance of sport mega-events as strategic sites of cultural analysis; (2) the politics and economics of the bid to host RWC 2011 and (3) the multidimensional nature of the contested terrain of RWC 2011 with respect to space, bodies and commodities. This paper concludes by contrasting the political rhetoric associated with sport mega-events with the lived realities and experience of citizens.",

While one can identify a long list of cases where sport has been credited with diverting conflict, contributing to peace negotiations and helping develop better cultural understanding, there are also many cases where sport has not only fueled conflict but also served as its source. This paper seeks to: (1) highlight the unique features of sport as a cultural site and practice in relation to diplomacy; (2) briefly overview some key dimensions and limitations of sport as an instrument of diplomacy; and (3) offer a preliminary examination of contemporary sport organizations and events in order to understand the implications of the transformational shift occurring between state diplomacy and what might be termed \u201ccorporate diplomacy\u201d within an increasingly global context.",

Specifically, it draws on the recommendations of the 2010 New Zealand Law Commission report titled Alcohol in our lives: Curbing the harm, which called for the gradual elimination of all alcohol sponsorship from New Zealand sport. Using a multi-method approach, the paper examines the contested terrain of the alcohol\u2013sport relationship, that is, the nature of the relationship and its potential impact on the nation\u2019s binge drinking culture, how it is regulated by both states and sport organisations within the international community and, finally, the perspectives of key stakeholders in the debate. The views of key stakeholders offer insights into the nature of competing interests at play within the alcohol\u2013sport sponsorship relationship. Overall, the findings highlight the challenges of social change and the need for more research and a community-based, multidimensional approach that is reinforced through regulation.",

By encompassing a multitude of forms including photographs, videos, maps, diagrams, symbols and so forth, images can provide specific information about our existence. They can also act as powerful indicators regarding the multiple meanings embedded within our culture. One domain where the use of visual methods has been less well documented is that of physical culture. Physical culture is taken here to mean human physical movement occurring within recognised cultural domains such as sport, dance and, more broadly, outdoor and indoor recreational activities involving expression through physicality. Opening this special edition of Qualitative Research in Sport and Exercise on \u2018Visual Methods in Physical Culture\u2019s\u2019, I provide some broad responses to the following questions: What are visual methods? Why might they be useful? How can they be utilised? I then outline some ongoing debates within the field surrounding issues of interpretation, representation and ethics. I conclude by positioning this special edition as a resource to assist with the continued use of visual methods in physical culture.",

      "abstractNote": "One of the most striking developments across the social sciences in the past decade has been the growth of research methods using visual materials. It is often suggested that this growth is somehow related to the increasing importance of visual images in contemporary social and cultural practice. However, the form of the relationship between \u2018visual research methods\u2019 and \u2018contemporary visual culture\u2019 has not yet been interrogated. This paper conducts such an interrogation, exploring the relation between \u2018visual research methods\u2019 \u2013 as they are constituted in quite particular ways by a growing number of handbooks, reviews, conference and journals \u2013 and contemporary visual culture \u2013 as characterized by discussions of \u2018convergence culture\u2019. The paper adopts a performative approach to \u2018visual research methods\u2019. It suggests that when they are used, \u2018visual research methods\u2019 create neither a \u2018social\u2019 articulated through culturally mediated images, nor a \u2018research participant\u2019 competency in using such images. Instead, the paper argues that the intersection of visual culture and \u2018visual research methods\u2019 should be located in their shared way of using images, since in both, images tend to be deployed much more as communicational tools than as representational texts. The paper concludes by placing this argument in the context of recent discussions about the production of sociological knowledge in the wider social field.",

After outlining a theory for building a historically grounded understanding of sport, culture, and ideology, the paper argues that organized sports have come to serve as a primary institutional means for bolstering a challenged and faltering ideology of male superiority in the 20th century. Increasing female athleticism represents a genuine quest by women for equality, control of their own bodies, and self-definition, and as such represents a challenge to the ideological basis of male domination. Yet this quest for equality is not without contradictions and ambiguities. The socially constructed meanings surrounding physiological differences between the sexes, the present \u201cmale\u201d structure of organized sports, and the media framing of the female athlete all threaten to subvert any counter-hegemonic potential posed by female athletes.

The larger socioeconomic and political context will continue to shape and constrain the extent to which women can wage fundamental challenges to the ways that organized sports continue providing ideological legitimation for male dominance. And the media's framing of male and female athletes will continue to present major obstacles for any fundamental challenge to the present commercialized and male-dominant structure of organized athletics. It remains for a critical feminist theory to recognize the emergent contradictions in this system in order to inform a liberating social practice.\" (<a href=\"zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DEHWDIPF?page=12\">Messner 1988:208</a>)</p>"

If gender is understood as a social construction, gender differences are not \u2018natural\u2019 but acquired and enacted, and also vary according to the particular social and gender order. Currently observable in many respects is a tendency towards \u2018gender bending\u2019 and gender play. This raises the question as to whether this dismantling and/or de-dramatization of gender differences in, as well as outside, sport is a sign pointing towards a new gender order. Or has gender enactment become more subtle? Have gender scripts shifted to other areas, for example to media sports with their focus on (hetero)sexuality? Which course will gender relations take in future, in as well as outside sport? In discussing the issues raised above, I will analyse the present situation and consider future developments with regard to sports participation, media sports and leadership in sport.",

It investigates some of the ways in which women's participation in these activities is constrained and the strategies women employ to carve out spaces for themselves in these sporting contexts. Women in both sports tend to engage in strategies rooted in middle-class and liberal notions of resistance. Most of these exemplify what researchers have called \u201creproductive agency.\u201d Some strategies, however, seem to exemplify \u201cresistant agency.\u201d The article explores the potential of these strategies to bring about meaningful social change.",

Despite playing a sport that was initially invented as women\u2019s basketball and in an association that has historically had a strong gay and trans* presence, they subscribe to rather hegemonic definitions of masculinity. All the players are both heterosexual and consider homosexuality incompatible with hegemonic masculinity. However, they also characterize homophobia as vulnerability and therefore a failure of masculine power. This suggests that there may be some shifts in definitions of hegemonic masculinity within this context. The traditional southern \u2018hard man\u2019 is therefore relegated to second-tier status: it is the man who tells his rugby mates that he likes netball that must \u2018have a bit of bloody strength\u2019.",

Despite the importance of the problem, debate continues, inaccurate and contra dictory statements abound, and consensus is largely absent. This paper attempts to overcome limited views to produce an adequate definition of sport, to locate its precise boundaries, and to ferret out its essential core., The research procedure consists of five major components: (1) a preliminary assessment of the requirements and difficulties of the task; (2) a systematic de lineation of the individual factors and characteristics deemed to be essential com ponents of the concept of sport in a rigorous scrutiny of more than fifty research studies which concern themselves, at least in part, with this task; (3) an extended, critical analysis of three major characteristics-the necessity and nature of physical skill or prowess, institutionalization, and the \"play-game-sport\" continuum; (4) the presentation of work towards an acceptable definition of sport; and (5) a differen tiation of the concept of sport from the concepts of play and game.",

      "abstractNote": "Drawing on work concerning novel risk factors associated with gender and physical disability, the present study applies an intersectionality perspective to examine: (1) the independent significance of three appraisals of the self and social relationships (i.e., self-esteem, mastery and emotional reliance), as well as perceived devaluation and functional limitation, for depressive symptoms among women and men with physical disabilities; (2) the interactive significance of these factors for psychological distress; and (3) whether these processes vary systematically by gender. Utilizing data from a U.S. community study of 214 women and 162 men ages 40\u201393 with physical disabilities in Miami-Dade County, Florida, OLS regression analysis demonstrates differences in the associations between these factors and depressive symptoms by gender. Emotional reliance is independently associated with depressive symptoms and interacts with perceived devaluation in the prediction of depressive symptoms only among women in this sample. Among the men surveyed, in contrast, self-esteem and mastery are both associated with depressive symptoms and both interact with perceived devaluation in predicting depressive symptoms. Findings are discussed in light of work linking gender differences in mental health with gender differences in appraisals of the self and social relationships.",

      "abstractNote": "The introduction of the social model of disability has attempted to move the spotlight of research away from the medical model theories of disability toward an investigation of the impacts of societal perceptions of disability upon people with disabilities. This article attempts to look at the impacts of societal perceptions of disability and disability sport, which in the main remain grounded in the medical model approach, upon people with disabilities in their attempts to become involved in and progress in their chosen sport. It also looks at the propensity for media coverage to recreate and reinforce many of the perceptions of disability present within the medical model approach to disability.",
