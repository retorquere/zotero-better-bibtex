      <description>Generating citekeys for your items The BibTeX citations keys generated by the standard Zotero exporters are always generated at time of export, using an algorithm that usually generates unique keys. For serious LaTeX users, “usually” presents the following problems:&#xA;If a non-unique key is generated, which one gets postfixed with a distinguishing character is essentially non-deterministic. The keys are always auto-generated, so if you correct a typo in the author name or title, the key will change You can’t see the citation keys until you export them For a LaTeX author, the citation keys have their own meaning, fully separate from the other entry data, even if people usually pick a naming scheme related to them. As the citation key is the piece of data that connects your bibliography, this is a piece of data you want to have control over. BBT offers you this control:</description>

      <description>PSA: as of Zotero 5.0.71, access to the CAYW URL will no longer work from the browser for security reasons; curl and other programmatic access such as from editors access will work.&#xA;Good news for TeXnicians and those down with Mark (aka Markdown, RST, whatnot): this is the time to go pester the author of your favorite editor for Zotero integration!&#xA;Editor integration vim Graciously supplied by David Lukes:&#xA;paste it in your .vimrc (and modify to your liking):</description>

      <title>Migrating from Word/Libreoffice</title>

      <description>So you have decided that enough is enough, and you want to migrate your existing Word/Libreoffice document to LaTeX/Markdown. Plenty (well…) tools exist to help with the migration of your document content, pandoc being the most prominent one, but one thing none of them will do is keep your citations intact. This will not do.&#xA;If you install this CSL style in Zotero (or modify it further and use that), Zotero will render the in-text citations as [@citekey] when you ask Zotero to render the bibliography. If you want LaTeX, modify the style accordingly. You can then put your document through pandoc or whatnot to get LaTeX/Markdown.</description>

      <title>AUX Scanner</title>

      <description>You can populate a collection, or tag items in your library, from an existing paper by scanning the aux file generated by bibtex, or a pandoc-markdown file, for referenced used. Scanning can be triggered from the Tools menu (for tagging the cited items) or by right-clicking a collection (for adding them to a collection). The scanner will read your AUX files and will put entries you cited in the associated LaTeX document into the current collection.</description>

      <title>Automatic export</title>

      <description>The Better BibTeX Configuration can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab ‘Better BibTeX’.&#xA;The configuration of Better BibTeX is a little baroque compared to the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters (which only have hidden preferences). The defaults should just work, but here’s an attempt to describe what they do.&#xA;Making any change here will drop your entire export cache. This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.</description>
