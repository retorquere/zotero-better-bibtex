    <description>The Better BibTeX Configuration can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab ‘Better BibTeX’.&#xA;The configuration of Better BibTeX is a little baroque compared to the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters (which only have hidden preferences). The defaults should just work, but here’s an attempt to describe what they do.&#xA;Making any change here will drop your entire export cache. This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.</description>
