Install by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest) -- if you use Firefox, make sure to right-click and save the XPI file, not just clicking it -- and then in Zotero:

1. In the main menu go to Tools > Plugins
2. Select 'Plugins'
3. Click on the gear in the top-right corner and choose 'Install Plugin From File...'
4. Choose .xpi that you've just downloaded, click 'Install'

After the initial installation, the plugin will auto-update to newer releases, so you should need to perform the process described here only once. 

**Note**: the default setting of BBT will generate different citekeys than Zotero would itself generate; the keys from Zotero are not always safe for use in bibtex/biber. If you want to get the stock zotero keys, set the pattern in the preferences to `zotero`. I very much recommend *not* choosing `zotero` as your pattern unless you have existing articles that use keys generated by previous Zotero-native BibTeX export.

**Note**: BBT needs to be installed in Zotero, *not* Firefox. There used to be two versions of Zotero, one standalone, and one that was installed in Firefox. BBT is a *Zotero* extension and lives where Zotero lives; Zotero is [no longer available](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-5-and-firefox-faq/) as a Firefox plugin, only as standalone. If you download BBT using Firefox by simply (left)clicking on it, Firefox will download it, think it is a Firefox plugin, try to install it, and will fail with a complaint it is corrupt, hence the right-click and save.
