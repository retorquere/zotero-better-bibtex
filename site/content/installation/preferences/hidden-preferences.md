The following settings are not exposed in the UI, but can be found under `Preferences`/`Advanced`/`Config editor` (that's Zotero's own `advanced` preferences, not BBT's). Zotero knows these as [hidden parameters](https://www.zotero.org/support/preferences/hidden_preferences).

All are prefixed with `extensions.zotero.translators.better-bibtex` in the table you will find there
