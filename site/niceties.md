* [Cite as you Write](cayw.html) for text-based editors such as Vi (or emacs, if you swing that way), and several others
* Integration with **[Report Customizer](citation-keys.html)**
* Integration with **[Zotfile](citation-keys.html)**
* **[Customized exports](export.html)**
* **Jabref groups import/export**: During import, if JabRef explicit (not dynamic) groups are present, collections will
  be created to mirror these. During export, collections will be added to the export as explicit jabref groups.
* **Fixes date field exports**: export dates like 'forthcoming' as 'forthcoming' instead of empty.
* **[Pull export](pull-export.html)** from the embedded webserver
* **[Automated export](pull-export.html)** of collections to keep your .bib files all fresh
* Automatic **[journal abbreviation](citation-keys.html)** to bring BibTeX export on par with the Word integration
* Preliminary scholarly markdown support through integration with [Zotero Citations for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/zotero-citations)
* Spectacular must-see support for scholarly markdown with auto-complete citations for [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/baig/brackets-zotero) by Wasif Hasan Baig
