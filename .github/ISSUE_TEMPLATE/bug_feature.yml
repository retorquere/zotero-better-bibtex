      Use this form if you want a change to BBT.

      Alongside a description of your problem/question/feature suggestion, please also include a debug log ID.

      You can generate a debug log ID by:
      1. reproducing the problem
      2. selecting the problematic reference(s)
      3. right-clicking them
      4. choose `BBT debug log` from the popup menu.

      Please be available in the days following your report for follow-up questions and testing.

      ## Please **DO NOT** enter "N/A" or somesuch in the debug log ID field.

      I am done explaining why this is needed. Just include one.

      *If the regular debug log submission does not work, use "send to bashupload.com" from the help menu.*

      If you are sure your question does not relate to items in your library at all, just select any one item in your library.
