    happen whenever an item in the export changes/is added/is removed. On idle

importSentenceCase:
  tooltip: >-
    Bib(La)TeX entries must be stored in Title Case; Zotero items are expected
    to be entered as sentence-case.


    With this option on, BBT will try to sentence-case during import. This
    sentence-casing uses heuristics, no natural language processing is
    performed, and the results are not perfect.


    You can turn this off, but you may then also want to disable `Apply
    title-casing to titles` (which has its own problems, see the help entry for
    that option on this page).

    With 'yes, but try to exclude already-sentence-cased titles', BBT will
    attempt to detect titles that are already sentence cased and leave them
    as-is on import.

    During import of bib(la)tex, these types will be treated as event-like, in which case if an entry has both
    an `location` and an `address` field, the `location` will go to Zotero's `Place` field. In all other instances,
    `address` will go to `Place`.
